# Deployments
I have deployed my project to Render.com and to Vercel

* Render.com: https://flavorverse-app.onrender.com
* Vercel: https://flavor-verse-sand.vercel.app

***MIND THAT: When you first open it you have to wait a little bit because after the first request the back-end needs time to start***

# How to run the application

First you have to clone my project:

```
git clone https://github.com/vilianakovacheva/FlavorVerse.git
```

Then in the terminal write ```npm install``` to install all the dependencies for this project.

When you have installed the dependencies, write in the terminal:
```
cd client
ng serve
```

Then there is no need to start the server, because my app uses the deployed server

And then open the link from your terminal that appeared after you typed ```ng serve``` so you can see my project.
