        <h2>1. Our Story: Bringing the World to Your Kitchen</h2>
        <img src="about-us-images/about-us.png" alt="people">
        <p>At Flavor<span>Verse</span>, we believe that food is more than just sustenance—it’s a universal language
            that connects people. What started as a small passion project has grown into a global community where
            home cooks, food lovers, and professional chefs share their favorite recipes. From family traditions
            passed down through generations to creative new takes on classic dishes, our platform celebrates the
            diversity of flavors and cultures from every corner of the world.</p>
